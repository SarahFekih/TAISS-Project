## Traceability Methods

We present three traceability methods that span the design space:

1. **Minimum Method:** Offers low granularity in terms of product tracking.
2. **Maximum Method:** Attempts to record every data point on the blockchain.
3. **BF-SUB Method:** Utilizes Bloom filters for product tracking, combined with [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/) to efficiently manage IoT sensor data.
